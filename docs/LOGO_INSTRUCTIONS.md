# Adding the Perseus Drive Logo

To add the logo to the repository and have it display properly in the README:

1. Create a directory structure in the repository: `/docs/assets/`
2. Save the provided Greek statue with circuit board design image as `perseus-logo.png` in that directory
3. Update the README.md file to use this image by replacing the placeholder comment with:

```markdown
<img src="docs/assets/perseus-logo.png" alt="Perseus Drive" width="800">
```

## Logo Design Elements

The logo represents the fusion of classical wisdom (Greek statues) with modern technology (circuit board patterns), symbolizing how Perseus Drive combines time-tested investment principles with cutting-edge AI capabilities.

The dark background with lighter statue elements creates an elegant, professional appearance suitable for a sophisticated financial technology product.

## Alternative Options

If you prefer to use a different image size or format:

1. Adjust the width parameter in the image tag as needed
2. Consider adding additional styling for better presentation

Example with centered badges:
```markdown
<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/perseus-logo.png" alt="Perseus Drive" width="800">
  <br>
  <a href="LICENSE"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Proprietary-red.svg" alt="License: Proprietary"></a>

  <a href="test/debug-suite.js"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg" alt="Build Status"></a>
</div>
