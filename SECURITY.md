## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Perseus Drive team takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

To report a security vulnerability, please email the maintainers directly at securityperseus@proton.me instead of opening a public issue.

Please include the following information:
- Type of issue
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- Location of the affected source code
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:
1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all affected versions
4. Release patched versions as soon as possible
